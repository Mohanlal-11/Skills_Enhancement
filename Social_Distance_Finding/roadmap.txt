1. A SOTA model to detect object  
2. Test that model i.e. visualize its detections.   
3. After testing the model, write and test a function that gives me a list which contains the bbox of objects after NMS and image(resized or original). (for one image) i.e. [[obj1], [obj2], [obj3]]
4. Then write and test a function to calculate distance between objects.
    Compare that calculated distance with threshold distance and draw the bboxes and line accordingly.
    write/show the image.
